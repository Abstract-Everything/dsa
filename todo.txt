Development:
	Features:
		DSA:
			Make the structures constexpr
			Exception safety
			Add Data Structures:
				Queue
				Stack
				Double ended queue
				Red-Black Tree
				B-Tree
				AVL Trees
				Hash tables
				Fibonacci Tree
			Algorithms:
				Traverse
				Sort
					Heap
					Quick
					Merge
					Insertion
					Linear time
				Minimum element
				Maximum element
				Maximum subarray
				Search
				Dynamic Programming
			Multithreading

	Improvements:
		DSA:
			Create a buffer class to encapsulate Alloc_Traits calls and dealing with uninitialised values.
			Create a class for a pointer base (Creates a pointer looking class given .get and .set functions for Value*)
			Memory_Representation could be managed by Memory_Monitor. It could store the state of the objects it monitors inside and allow the current Event_Handlers to use the visits to extract the information that they require. We would probably need to separate the Memory_Monitor into an Allocator and a State class. So that the State is not in a different instance based on the template parameter.

		Visual:
			Nodes should automatically place themselves not require the user to drag them manually
			Memory view (Vertical bars of sets of bytes + memory addresses)
			Animate move and copy assignments

			Process one command at a time and show what it is

	Issues:
		DSA:
			Binary_Tree does not account for duplicates
			Object_Event_Type::Underlying_(Copy/Move)_Assign can be merged together into Underlying_Value_Assign

		Visual:
			Container queries run per frame so non constant operations dirty the log with duplicated events
			User interface shows the current read value instead of what the visualisation shows (It pulls from the actual vector rather than the visual representation of it)
			Simplify memory representation classes
			Viewport should not have rendering code + rename the class
			Use the size to determine if a pointer is pointing to the buffer or to a particular value
			Pop should not be clickable when there are no items in the heap


	Research:
		Research about allocator best practices
		Web assembly to run in browser
		C++20 features:
			C++ Modules
			Start using C++ concepts
			Use three way comparison operator

Documentation:
	Write reason the file exits at the top
	Write descriptions for classes
	Write descriptions for functions
	Create a document in folders to explain the design of the components

Testing:
	Use Memory_Monitor_Event_Handler_Fixture in all the tests that need a handler

	DSA:
		Memory_Representation is currently untested. It was moved from inside Allocation_Verifier - which is tested but during the extraction the tests were not written for it. The tests for Allocation_Verifier can now be set up by creating a memory representation instance and passing it directly to the verifier, instead of creating it through the interface (decide if this option is better or not)
